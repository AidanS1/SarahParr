<p>We used to brag about scars when we were children, but only the pure ones that reside on our 
fingers and knees; definitely not the ones that were consciously covered. Scars that etched 
stories into our bodies, the numbing ache still present even as the fissures closes. Now scars 
only remind us of the burden surrounding pain-of the weight skin can carry-and it mkes me wonder 
how much can change before you've murdered the very idea of yourself. I looked to the stars, how 
the tarnished the emptiness around them, and tried to imagine my connection to the universe. 
I saw myself being born, each happy day and cold night, and I saw myself growing old, rivers of 
wrinkles drenching my body. I saw my bones and flesh disintegrating into the ground but I also 
saw civilizations fall and waves crash over my grave. My stories riddled my body in intricate 
patterns, ridges and craters dancing on the surgace no matter the attempts to wash them from my 
body or cover them with clouds. But there was no connection between myself and the sky, I was 
just a mortal begging to be set free. And there's no word that can truly describe this feeling, 
no sound that can heal the struggle of being definite in a world that is infinite. But here I 
stand in my hill of strs, connecting the marks on my skin with my fingertips as if they are 
constellations, and wait.
